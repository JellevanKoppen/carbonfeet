## Introduction

Climate change is widely recognized as one of the biggest global
challenges of our time. Governments, companies, and organizations are
increasingly taking action to reduce emissions. However, for
individuals, understanding and managing personal CO₂ impact remains
difficult.

Most people do not have a clear understanding of how their daily choices
translate into carbon emissions. Even those who care about
sustainability often lack the tools to measure, track, and improve their
behavior in a meaningful and motivating way.

## Core Problem

CO₂ emissions are largely invisible in everyday life.

People make decisions such as: - Booking flights\
- Driving a car\
- Eating meat\
- Using energy at home

But they rarely see the direct environmental impact of these actions.

Without visibility, there is no feedback loop.\
Without feedback, there is little motivation to change behavior.

## Emotional Gap

Sustainable choices often feel like sacrifices:

-   Flying less\
-   Eating less meat\
-   Driving less\
-   Consuming less

But there is no immediate reward, no progress indicator, and no sense of
achievement.

This creates a psychological disconnect: People know sustainability
matters, but they do not feel the impact of their personal contribution.

## Current Solutions Fall Short

Existing carbon footprint tools typically have one or more of the
following problems:

### 1) One-Time Calculations

Most tools provide a single estimate based on a questionnaire.

Problems: - Static result - No ongoing tracking - No progress
visibility - No behavioral reinforcement

### 2) Too Abstract

Many platforms present emissions as large, hard-to-interpret numbers
without context.

Users often ask: - Is this good? - Is this bad? - Am I above average? -
What should I do next?

### 3) Low Personal Relevance

Generic calculators often rely on broad averages instead of personal
data, making results feel distant and impersonal.

### 4) Lack of Motivation

Most tools: - Inform\
- But do not motivate\
- Do not show progress over time\
- Do not reward improvement

### 5) No Continuous Feedback Loop

People need reinforcement to change behavior.

Fitness apps succeed because they: - Track daily actions\
- Show progress\
- Create goals\
- Provide motivation

Carbon tracking tools rarely do this.

## The Opportunity

There is a gap between awareness and action.

Many people: - Care about climate impact\
- Want to make better choices\
- But lack clear insight into their personal footprint

What's missing is a tool that makes emissions:

-   Personal\
-   Visible\
-   Trackable\
-   Understandable\
-   Motivating

## Target User Mindset

The primary audience consists of people who:

-   Are climate-aware or climate-curious\
-   Want insight into their lifestyle impact\
-   Are open to improving their behavior\
-   Appreciate data and progress tracking

They are not necessarily activists.\
They simply want to understand and do better.

## The Key Insight

People change behavior when they can:

-   Measure it\
-   See progress\
-   Compare themselves to a reference\
-   Feel rewarded for improvement

This is why fitness trackers, budgeting apps, and habit trackers are
effective.

CarbonFeet applies the same principle to CO₂ emissions.

## Problem Summary

Today, individuals lack:

-   Clear visibility into their personal emissions\
-   Continuous tracking\
-   Context (is this good or bad?)\
-   Motivation to improve\
-   Feedback on their progress

As a result, awareness does not consistently translate into action.

## Our Response

CarbonFeet addresses this gap by turning carbon emissions into something
that can be tracked, understood, and improved over time.

Instead of a one-time calculation, CarbonFeet creates:

-   A continuous personal footprint timeline\
-   A yearly projection\
-   A clear comparison with national averages\
-   A visual progress experience\
-   A sense of ownership and responsibility

This transforms CO₂ from an abstract concept into a personal metric
people can actively manage.
