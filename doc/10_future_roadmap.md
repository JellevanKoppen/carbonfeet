## Purpose

This document outlines the long-term vision and expansion strategy for
CarbonFeet beyond the MVP.

The MVP focuses on awareness, tracking, and projections.\
The roadmap defines how the product can evolve into a richer platform
that increases engagement, impact, and reach over time.

The roadmap is structured in logical phases, not strict timelines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 1 --- MVP Foundation (Launch Phase)

Primary goal: Validate that users want to track their personal CO₂
footprint and stay engaged.

Core delivered capabilities: - Personal footprint dashboard - Flight
logging - Car usage tracking - Diet baseline - Energy baseline -
End-of-year projection - Comparison to country average - Achievements
(basic)

Success signals: - Users return weekly - Users log flights - Users check
projections regularly - Users become more aware of their impact

This phase proves the concept.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 2 --- Social Layer

Primary goal: Increase motivation and retention through social dynamics.

Potential features:

### Friends System

-   Add friends
-   Private or public profiles
-   Share total emissions or category breakdowns

### Leaderboards

Rank users based on: - Lowest absolute emissions - Most improved over
time

### Social Accountability

-   See how you compare to your circle
-   Encourage healthier competition

Privacy requirements: - Opt-in sharing - Control over visibility -
Private mode supported

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 3 --- Behavior Challenges

Primary goal: Turn awareness into action through structured challenges.

Examples: - Meat-free week - No-flight month - Drive-less challenge

Features: - Join challenges - Track impact of participation - See how
much projection improves

This strengthens motivation and engagement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 4 --- Expanded Tracking

Primary goal: Capture a more complete picture of lifestyle impact.

New categories:

### Consumption Tracking

-   Clothing purchases
-   Electronics
-   Online shopping

### Public Transport

-   Train usage
-   Bus/metro usage

### AI Usage

-   Estimated emissions based on prompts/day

### Household Mode

-   Shared profiles
-   Family tracking

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 5 --- Integrations

Primary goal: Reduce manual input and increase accuracy.

Possible integrations:

### Travel Integrations

-   Airline account linking
-   Automatic flight detection

### Mobility

-   Car apps
-   Mileage trackers

### Energy

-   Energy providers
-   Smart home systems

### Financial

-   Expense-based emission estimation

These features reduce friction and increase realism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 6 --- Personal Insight Engine

Primary goal: Help users understand how to improve.

Possible features:

-   Personalized recommendations:
    -   "One less flight reduces X"
    -   "Reducing driving by 10% lowers projection by Y"
-   Smart notifications
-   Behavioral insights

This transforms CarbonFeet from a tracker into a guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 7 --- CO₂ Compensation Ecosystem

Primary goal: Offer users ways to act beyond reducing.

Potential ideas:

-   Tree planting partnerships
-   Verified compensation projects
-   Personal offset tracking

Important consideration: - Avoid fraud risks - Focus on trusted
partners - Keep it optional and transparent

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 8 --- Institutional Expansion

Primary goal: Expand impact beyond individuals.

Potential directions:

### Companies

-   Employee awareness programs
-   Team challenges
-   Sustainability dashboards

### Education

-   Schools and universities
-   Awareness programs

### Government / NGOs

-   Public awareness campaigns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase 9 --- Advanced Accuracy Layer

Primary goal: Improve realism without harming simplicity.

Enhancements could include:

-   Better vehicle databases
-   Regional energy mix refinement
-   Aircraft efficiency improvements
-   Dynamic emission factors

This phase strengthens credibility over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Long-Term Vision

CarbonFeet can evolve into:

-   A personal climate awareness platform
-   A lifestyle impact tracker
-   A social motivation ecosystem
-   A sustainability behavior tool

The core remains the same: Helping individuals understand and reduce
their footprint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Growth Ambition

Target scale: - 50K--100K users in early growth stage

Success at this scale would validate: - Engagement model -
Product-market fit - Social expansion potential

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategic Philosophy

The roadmap follows a clear progression:

1)  Awareness\
2)  Insight\
3)  Motivation\
4)  Social reinforcement\
5)  Automation\
6)  Action

Each phase builds on the previous one.

The product should never become: - Overly complex - Data-heavy without
meaning - Difficult to use

Simplicity must remain a core principle.
