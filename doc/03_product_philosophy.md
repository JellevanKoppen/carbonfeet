## Purpose

CarbonFeet is designed to turn an abstract global problem into a
personal, understandable, and actionable experience.

The product philosophy focuses on motivation over guilt, clarity over
complexity, and progress over perfection.

The goal is not to judge users, but to help them understand their impact
and feel encouraged to improve it over time.

## Core Principles

### 1) Simplicity First

CarbonFeet must be extremely easy to understand and use.

Most users: - Are not climate experts - Do not want to manage complex
data - Want quick insights

The interface should always feel: - Clean - Minimal - Intuitive

Complex calculations happen in the background.\
The user only sees clear, meaningful results.

### 2) Personal Over Generic

CarbonFeet focuses on the individual.

Instead of broad estimates, the app prioritizes: - Personal behavior -
Personal habits - Personal data inputs

The experience should feel tailored, not averaged.

Users should feel: "This is about me."

### 3) Motivation Over Guilt

The app should never feel like punishment.

Instead, it should: - Reward improvement - Highlight progress -
Encourage small steps

The emotional direction is:

-   70% motivating and positive\
-   20% calm and minimal\
-   10% slightly confrontational when needed

When users reduce their emissions, they should feel proud.

When users are above average, they should feel encouraged to improve ---
not judged.

### 4) Progress Is the Product

CarbonFeet is not just a calculator.

It is a tracker.

Users should be able to: - See their footprint over time - Notice when
it decreases - Understand what caused the change

This mirrors the psychology of fitness trackers: Progress creates
motivation.

### 5) Insight Drives Change

People change behavior when they can see impact.

CarbonFeet provides: - Year-to-date emissions - End-of-year
projections - Category breakdowns - Comparison to national averages

This gives users context: - Am I doing well? - Where can I improve?

### 6) Realistic, Not Academic

CarbonFeet aims to be as realistic as possible per individual.

However, it does not aim to be scientifically perfect.

Guiding principle: - 95% simple - 70% accurate

This balance ensures: - Usability - Accessibility - Trustworthy
estimates

Users should understand: These are realistic indicators, not exact
scientific measurements.

### 7) Visibility Creates Awareness

CO₂ emissions are invisible in daily life.

CarbonFeet makes them visible through: - Visual dashboards - Green vs
red zones - Trends over time - Forecasts

When people can see their impact, awareness increases naturally.

### 8) Small Wins Matter

Behavioral change happens through small improvements.

CarbonFeet supports this through: - Badges - Achievements - Positive
reinforcement - Visible reductions

Even small changes should feel meaningful.

### 9) Data Should Feel Human

Numbers alone do not motivate people.

CarbonFeet translates data into: - Clear visuals - Simple comparisons -
Personal context

The app should always answer: - What does this mean? - Am I improving?

### 10) Built for Growth

While the MVP focuses on core tracking, the philosophy supports
long-term expansion:

Future directions may include: - Social comparison - Challenges -
Partnerships - CO₂ compensation integrations

But the foundation remains the same: Personal insight first.

## Experience Summary

CarbonFeet should feel like:

-   A fitness tracker for emissions\
-   A financial dashboard for lifestyle impact\
-   A minimalist tool for personal awareness

It should always remain: - Simple - Personal - Motivating -
Insight-driven

## Philosophy in One Sentence

CarbonFeet helps people understand their personal impact and motivates
them to reduce it by making progress visible, meaningful, and rewarding.
