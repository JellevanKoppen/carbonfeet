## Product Name
CarbonFeet

## Vision Statement
CarbonFeet helps people become aware of their personal CO₂ footprint and motivates them to actively reduce it through clear insight, visible progress, and concrete feedback.

The app translates abstract climate impact into something personal, measurable, and understandable, allowing users to better understand their behavior and improve it step by step.

## Core Mission
The primary goals of CarbonFeet are:

- Create awareness  
- Encourage behavioral change  
- Give users a sense of progress and motivation  

The app should not only inform, but actively encourage action.

## The Problem
For most people, CO₂ emissions are invisible.

Living more sustainably often feels like:
- Flying less  
- Eating less meat  
- Consuming less  

But there is no direct, tangible reward in return.

As a result, sustainable living can feel like “giving things up” without seeing the benefits.

## Our Belief
If people can see, understand, and track their emissions — similar to a fitness tracker — motivation naturally follows.

Not through guilt, but through:

- Seeing progress  
- Reaching goals  
- Making more conscious choices  
- Experiencing that small changes make a real difference  

## Product Philosophy
CarbonFeet is not a guilt-driven app.  
CarbonFeet is a progress-driven app.

Users should feel:
- More aware  
- Motivated  
- Proud of improvement  

Not judged.

## Emotional Goal
After using the app, a user should think:

> "I can see my impact, and I can do something about it."

And when their emissions decrease:

> "I’m doing a good job."

## Experience Direction

CarbonFeet feels like a combination of:

- A fitness tracker (progress & goals)  
- A financial dashboard (overview & transactions)  
- A minimalist lifestyle app (simple & clear)  

The overall experience is:

- 70% motivating and positive  
- 20% calm and minimal  
- 10% slightly confrontational when needed  

## Long-Term Impact

If CarbonFeet succeeds:

- People become structurally more aware of their behavior  
- Users see their emissions decrease year over year  
- A new norm emerges: understanding your personal CO₂ impact  

The ultimate goal is not just to show data, but to drive real behavioral change on an individual level.

## Product Identity (One-Liner)

CarbonFeet is the first app that combines personal CO₂ tracking with clear insights and progress feedback, giving people a realistic and motivating understanding of their climate impact.

## Success Definition

Success means users:

- Understand their emissions  
- Regularly check their impact  
- Make small adjustments to their behavior  
- Live more consciously than before  

Awareness is the first win.  
Behavioral change is the real win.
